Automate production of design specifications (“specs”) of selected components, instances and frames. Building on a belief that understanding a component’s architecture shouldn’t be a treasure hunt, plugin output is useful for design-dev handoff, auditing in progress design work, and critiquing with teammates. Output includes:

Anatomy with marked layers and annotated dependencies, instance props and other unvarying attributes
Props that compare attributes across each variant and highlights of layers associated with boolean props
Layout and spacing of layers with autolayout, describing attributes and annotating artwork with markers and lines

A Pro subscription, available for upgrade within the plugin, adds support for Figma variables, Tokens Studio tokens, custom spec formatting, dark mode specs, and more.
