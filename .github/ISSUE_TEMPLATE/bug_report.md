### Problem

Describe the bug in a sentence or two.

### Source file to troubleshoot

Access to the frame/instance(s) that trigger the defect are essential for the plugin maker to troubleshoot the issue. A screenshot of the vague Figma error message is not enough. If possible, provide access to a view-only Figma file – even with JUST the frame or instance in it – by pasting the shared link below or DM'ing Nathan privately in the Specs Plugin Slack (https://join.slack.com/t/eightshapes-specs/shared_invite/zt-1w4k19pj7-viPHKW8045zak64u~lH4yA).

{Paste link here}

### Screenshots

If possible, paste screenshots from your clipboard, including ideally:
* Current Specs plugin UI settings (if a defect is currently displayed, restart the plugin and screenshot those settings)
* Frame(s)/instance(s) on which the plugin is being run
* Output the plugin produced
* Bug(s) displayed in the plugin's UI
